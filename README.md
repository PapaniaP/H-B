## Process

### Research

- **Competitor Analysis:** Understanding the strategies employed by larger financial firms in the online space was crucial. This analysis provided insights into why and how successful competitors use digital platforms.

- **User Research:** To precisely define our target audience, we combined desk research with insights from our client. This process led us to profile our ideal client as individuals in their early 30s, likely with stable jobs, income, families, and a strong desire for financial stability and responsibility.

### Mission, Values, and Vision

- **Core Values:** Our research uncovered the core values of HLOUŠEK & BROKERS: trust, transparency, and customer centricity.

- **Mission:** We identified the company's mission as maintaining beneficial relationships and honoring business principles.

- **Vision:** While a clear vision statement was not available, one of the values emphasized the importance of the future and financial optimization.

### Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas

### Experience Mapping

- We developed detailed requirements and values to guide our design process effectively.

### Design

- **Lo-fi Wireframes:** Initial low-fidelity wireframes were instrumental in finalizing layouts efficiently.

- **Moodboard:** We gathered inspiration and established the tone of the website through a moodboard.

- **Hi-fi Wireframes:** Our detailed hi-fi wireframes were created using Figma, ensuring that the design was aligned with user expectations. These wireframes were iterated upon based on user testing feedback.

- **Design System:** To maintain branding consistency, we created a comprehensive design system that facilitated smooth navigation and ensured a cohesive user experience.

### Content Creation

- Professional photography sessions were conducted at the company's offices to provide authentic visuals.

- Establishing the correct tone of voice was essential to resonate with the target audience effectively.

- Content was integrated into the hi-fi wireframes, and the design was further prototyped with content. This process underwent another round of user testing, leading to design refinements.

### Development

- We chose WordPress and Elementor for the development phase, as they allowed for advanced styling and layout options while ensuring responsiveness.

- Various plugins, including Metform for the contact form and Calendly for the booking system, were integrated to add essential functionalities.

- Custom CSS and JS were employed to implement advanced features.

- The first iteration of development was tested to ensure functionality. However, due to time constraints, further improvements were not possible at that stage. The project remains a work in progress.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project involved the creation of [hlousekbrokers.sk](https://www.hlousekbrokers.sk/), providing HLOUŠEK & BROKERS with an online platform to showcase their financial expertise and values. Our solution is expected to attract new clients, enhancing the company's position in the Slovak financial market.

## Perspective Thoughts and Challenges

### Iterations

- Throughout the design process, we prioritized iterative improvements based on user testing feedback. Continuous gathering of user feedback will remain central to our efforts in creating a user-centric design.

### Collaboration

- Effective collaboration and communication among team members and stakeholders played a critical role in the project's success. Clear expectations and open dialogue ensured alignment and a shared vision.

### Limitations and Considerations

- Limited availability of interview and user testing participants impacted quantitative results and accuracy. Future plans include allocating more resources for recruiting participants within the target audience for improved research and testing.

- Ongoing maintenance and updates to the UX design will be necessary to keep pace with evolving user needs and technological advancements.

### Responsive Design

- Recognizing the importance of responsive design in today's digital landscape, we plan to prioritize its implementation. While our initial focus was on desktop design, we understand the need to adapt to various devices and screen sizes.

### Future Plans

- We are dedicated to listening to users, making continuous improvements, and keeping up with new technologies. By focusing on what users want, we plan to continue iterating on the design and features. Our future work will maintain constant contact with stakeholders and users.

- Immediate plans include enhancing responsive design, implementing a more structured booking and contact system, and improving the website's SEO for greater visibility.

- Improve performance, load times and image optimization.
